// I am not sure what this questions wants,
// Is it a program that will print the longest line nomatter the length, exceeding the MAXLINE define
// Or is it allowing any length of line but only printing it till a certain (arbitrary point)
// Or is only printing the length of the longest line that does not surpass a certain line????
// Honestly I am skipping this one cause one of these would probably need malloc/realloc and the other two seem to easy to be a meaningful exercise.
